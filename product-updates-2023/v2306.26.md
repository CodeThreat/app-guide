# v2306.26

Here at CodeThreat, we believe in transparency and openness about our development process. Our team, while small, operates with remarkable speed and consistency. We're not just developers; we're enthusiasts who take pride in our work and the advancements we're making in the field of static code analysis.

We consider our changelogs to be more than just a list of updates and new features. They're our development blogs, a window into our development world, allowing us to share our journey, challenges, victories, and the sheer excitement we feel for our work.



### ðŸŒŸ Update: 26-06-2023

ðŸš€ New Features

**API Backbone Overhaul:** We've gone through a development sprint this month, focusing on revamping some of the critical elements of our API components. This includes changes to the database, message brokers, and other technical capabilities to enhance our cloud scalability. This was a challenging yet rewarding experience. \
\
A key outcome of this overhaul is a noticeable reduction in the memory usage of the API while scanning a codebase. This improvement is especially significant for on-premise versions of CodeThreat, as the cloud version operates with a different configuration. With lower memory consumption, our on-premise users can expect more efficient scans, potentially speeding up the analysis process.

However, we would like to note that this change in the API's backbone is not backward compatible. That said, we've ensured that this alteration will not affect API consumers, and your interaction with CodeThreat should remain seamless. We've taken meticulous steps to keep the user experience consistent and maintain the service's integrity you've come to expect from CodeThreat.

As always, we appreciate your understanding and support as we continue to evolve CodeThreat, providing you with a more robust, efficient, and high-performing code analysis solution.\


**Enhanced Privacy with Scan Container Destruction:** Privacy is paramount, and in accordance with stringent privacy regulations, we've changed how we handle scans. Post the scan of a target codebase, we now ensure the complete destruction of the scanner container. This change ensures that we don't store any customer-related information or code on our backend, bolstering the privacy of your codes.\

**OpenAI Integration for On-Premise Users:** In our ongoing efforts to expand our service capabilities, we're thrilled to announce that on-premise users can now opt to permit connection settings to our Azure OpenAI infrastructure. This means that they can now leverage our powerful AI features, previously limited to cloud-based users. This integration provides on-premise users with the same high-quality insights and recommendations to streamline their coding process and improve code quality. As always, we're dedicated to aligning our service with your needs, ensuring that you get the most out of your CodeThreat experience.

We're here to help and ensure that your experience with CodeThreat is smooth, secure, and compliant.

\
**Cloud Soft Launch:** As we continue to push boundaries and expand our services, we're excited to announce our cloud-based application's soft launch on Product Hunt on June 30.

During the soft launch phase, we will steadily and incrementally upgrade the app based on user interactions, feedback, and our ongoing commitment to quality. This iterative improvement process will ensure that we deliver an application that meets the highest standards of quality and user experience. We greatly appreciate your support and feedback as we embark on this exciting new chapter.

**Complete UI Overhaul:** In our continuous efforts to improve user experience, we've completely transformed our user interface. Our newly overhauled UI is designed to be more intuitive, efficient, and user-friendly. We're excited for you to navigate through it.

#### Project Import Page

&#x20;   As a part of our complete User Interface overhaul, we've given our project import page a fresh, new look. The Project Import page now provides a more visually appealing, streamlined, and user-friendly experience, enabling you to effortlessly import your projects into CodeThreat. As always, we're excited for you to see and interact with our improved interface. We believe it'll make your journey with CodeThreat even more seamless and enjoyable.

#### Issue Details&#x20;

&#x20;   One of the highlights of our UI overhaul is the redesigned Issue Details page. This new interface provides a high level of detail for each identified issue, enhancing your understanding of the problem at hand. A key feature is the inclusion of an intuitive issue dataflow trace, which allows you to follow the issue's path through the code. This new design not only enhances the visual appeal of the page but also enables a deeper understanding of the issues, empowering you to address them more effectively. We're confident that this enhancement will significantly improve your CodeThreat experience, and we can't wait for you to try it.

**Enhanced JS-TS Analysis and Rule Set:** Staying at the forefront of code analysis means constantly evolving our toolset and methodologies. This month, we've made significant strides in our JavaScript and TypeScript (JS-TS) analysis capabilities.\

_Our commitment to providing a robust, versatile, and user-friendly platform remains unwavering, and the latest improvements and new features are a testament to that commitment. However, we know the work doesn't stop here. We'll keep pushing the boundaries of code analysis, consistently aiming to exceed expectations, and continue with our customer-centric approach._

_In the coming month, we'll be rolling out more exciting features, implementing feedback, and improving our services further. Keep an eye on our updates, and don't hesitate to get in touch if you have any questions, suggestions, or feedback._

_Thank you for being part of our journey. Until next time, happy coding!_
