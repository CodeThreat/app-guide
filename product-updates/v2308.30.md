## üåü Latest Update: v2308.30

### üöÄ New Features

* **Azure TFVC Support**: Support for Azure TFVC has been added, both as an extension and as part of our broader integration. And it is [open sourced now! ](https://github.com/CodeThreat/codethreat-azure-plugin)
* **GitLab CI/CD Plugin Integration**: We've officially launched the [CodeThreat GitLab CI/CD plugin](https://github.com/CodeThreat/codethreat-gitlab-plugin). This pivotal enhancement streamlines the vulnerability scanning process directly within the GitLab CI/CD pipeline. Now, developers can detect and address vulnerabilities in real-time, ensuring secure code deployment and efficient workflows.
* **API Optimization**: More accurate filtering in the Scan-Log API. This leads more faster responses if the repository have tons of issues to show.

### üêõ Bug Fixes

* **Manually Imported Code Base**: Enhanced handling of tar.gz files after the scan.
* **Auth Module Adjustments**: Adjustments have been made for better handling of different user roles.
* **File Upload Process**: Addressed a potential risk by ensuring files are properly closed after the upload process.
* **Scan Termination Bug:** Addressed an issue where scans would sometimes terminate prematurely without covering the entire codebase.
* **Reporting Inconsistency:** Fixed inconsistencies in the vulnerability report generation process which occasionally omitted certain details.
* **Path Pruning:** Resolved an issue where non-viable data paths were not being correctly pruned from analysis, improving performance.
* **UI Updates for CodeThreat Web App**:
  * **Breadcrumb Refinement**: Improved breadcrumb navigation ensuring better in-app navigation.
  * **Settings Enhancements**: Added a note for the license settings page and introduced a Max Upload Limit field to streamline user preferences.
  * **Azure & GitHub Field Controls**: Enhanced the field controls during project creation for better user guidance.&#x20;
  * **UI Refinements**: Addressed minor UI issues including the horizontal scrollbar, font inconsistencies, and provided additional UI tweaks.

**Internal Updates:**

* **Database Update Mechanism:** Recognizing the importance of backward compatibility for our user base, we have established an internal database update mechanism. This ensures that as we roll out new features and improvements, existing functionalities remain consistent and uninterrupted. Our aim is to provide our customers with a seamless experience, reducing disruptions commonly associated with major updates.
