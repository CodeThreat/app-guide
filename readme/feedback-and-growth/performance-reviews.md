# Performance Reviews

Quarterly performance reviews assess individual progress, contributions, and areas for development. Both team members and their supervisors provide feedback to each other, focusing on knowledge improvement, product contribution, and alignment with user benefits.\
\
By keeping our feedback and growth system concise and focused, we ensure that team members are well-prepared, continuously developing, and fully integrated into the team dynamics.
