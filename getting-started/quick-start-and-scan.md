#### **4. Integration Service:**

You'll be presented with a page, as shown in the previously provided image:

* **Integrations**: This section allows you to integrate with different cloud services. You have three options to choose from:
  * **GitHub**
  * **Azure**
  * **GitLab** (as indicated in the image, this was the selected option)

If you choose an on-premises integration (often labeled as "Onprem"), you will have an additional option compared to the cloud integrations:

* **Upload**: This feature allows users to directly upload ZIP files, making it easier to integrate local projects or datasets into the platform.
