#### **4. Integration Service:**

You'll be presented with a page, as shown in the previously provided image:

* **Integrations**: This section allows you to integrate with different cloud services. You have three options to choose from:
  * **GitHub**
  * **Azure**
  * **GitLab**&#x20;
  * Bitbucket Cloud

If you choose an on-premises integration (often labeled as "Onprem"), you will have an additional option compared to the cloud integrations:

* **Upload**: This feature allows users to directly upload ZIP files, making it easier to integrate local projects or datasets into the platform.
* **Git**: Opt for a generic Git server if you host your repository on-premise.
*   **Bitbucket Server**: For those who use Bitbucket on their own servers,

    select this option for integration.

* **Policy Selection**: Define and select the policies that suit your project's needs.
* **Integration**: Integrate your chosen service with the platform.
* **Project Created!**: Once you've gone through the above steps, your project will be created!

**Policies**

* **Advanced Security**: Select this for a comprehensive security scan that goes beyond basic checks.
* **OWASP Top 10 Focus**: Choose this policy to focus on the top 10 security risks identified by OWASP.
* **API Security**: Ideal for projects with an emphasis on secure API implementation.
* **Code Quality - Best Practices**: Picks up common code issues and ensures best practices are followed.
* **Data - Privacy Protection**: Use this policy to prioritize the protection of personal and sensitive data.
* **Mobile Security**: Select this if your project is a mobile application requiring specialized security checks.
* **Cryptography - Authentication**: Ensures that encryption and authentication mechanisms in your code are robust.
* **File - Resource Management**: Checks for efficient and secure file and resource management in your code.
* **Web Client-Side Security**: This policy focuses on security risks associated with client-side web applications.
* **Sensitive Information Exposure**: Protects against accidental exposure of sensitive information.
* **SAST Scan**: Static Application Security Testing to identify security vulnerabilities.
* **SCA Scan**: Software Composition Analysis for managing open-source components and licenses.
* **Decompiled Code Scan**: This policy is crucial if your project involves reverse-engineering or working with decompiled code. It ensures that the transformed code adheres to security standards and detects any vulnerabilities that may be introduced during the decompilation process.

#### 6. Review & Finalize:
