**Why We Use Deno in Backend Services**

[Deno ](https://deno.com)is widely used for our project's API. We build strong and efficient microservices with it to manage different parts of our application, such as:

* **API Services**: Creating and managing endpoints for different functionalities.
* **Microservices**: Developing feature-based services that are modular and scalable.
* **Server-side Processes**: Handling server-side logic and interactions with other services.

**How We Work with Deno**

Our development process with Deno involves:



* **Feature-based Services**: Each feature has its own microservice, which is isolated and task-focused. This makes the system modular and easier to manage.
* **Custom Build Scripts**: Our custom scripts handle the build and deployment of over 70 repositories, automating the process for consistency and efficiency.
* **CI/CD Integration**: We include Deno in our CI/CD pipeline to create a deployment-ready product, ensuring smooth integration and continuous delivery.

CodeThreat Web Services does not have any custom database connector, so we only support mongodb right now.
