# Purpose

This handbook serves as a comprehensive guide to our systems, processes, and values. It helps maintain organization and supports continuous improvement by identifying areas for development. As a living document, it evolves with us, reflecting our commitment to excellence.

Over the years, alongside our product iterations, we have developed various tools and methods to address our challenges more efficiently. The primary purpose of this handbook is to ensure these systems are documented and continually improved. It allows us to identify and discuss our issues openly, providing a foundation for responsibility chains and what we refer to as "expectation resetting."

By keeping this document open to everyone, we ensure that all team members understand their responsibilities and expectations clearly. This transparency fosters a culture of accountability and continuous improvement, essential for our success.
