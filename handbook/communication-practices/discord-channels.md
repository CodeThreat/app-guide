# Discord Channels

## Why Discord?

We chose Discord over Slack for several reasons that align with our team culture and operational needs:

**Fun and Engaging**: Discord offers a more fun and engaging environment. Its gaming roots and casual atmosphere resonate well with our team, making daily interactions more enjoyable.

**Customization**: While Discord didn’t come with built-in support for many of the integrations we needed, we saw this as an opportunity rather than a drawback. We enjoyed the challenge of developing custom integration tools, such as commit ranking bots and CI/CD release pipelines. This process allowed us to tailor our tools specifically to our workflow, creating a unique and efficient system that fits our needs perfectly.

Here's how we use our Discord channels to keep everyone connected and in sync:

**General Communication**

* **#main**: This is the main hub for company-wide announcements, updates, and important news. It’s where everyone stays informed about the latest happenings at CodeThreat.
* **#off-topic**: A space for casual conversations and non-work-related discussions, helping to build team camaraderie and a sense of community.

**Collaboration and Support**

* **#help-center**: A dedicated channel where team members can ask for help or offer assistance. It’s all about supporting each other to overcome challenges and achieve our goals.

**Focused Work Streams**

* **Security Street**: Channels like **#Roslyn** and **#Ares** focus on specific meeting topics. Team members use these to share updates, discuss issues, and collaborate.
* **DevOps**: Channels like **#release-bot** and **#deploy-status** keep everyone informed about the status of deployments and releases, ensuring smooth and coordinated operations.

**Project and Task Management**

* **#commit-status**: Provides updates on the status of code commits, helping developers keep track of changes and ensure code quality.
* **#task-discussion**: A space for discussing specific tasks, sharing progress, and addressing any issues that arise during development.

**Development and Bugs**
