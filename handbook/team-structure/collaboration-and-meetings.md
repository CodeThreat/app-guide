Teams regularly come together to discuss sprint iterations and collaborative projects. Discoveries from the Product Team can impact the Analyzer and AppSec Research Teams, and vice versa. Collaboration is facilitated through shared communication channels and task management platforms, ensuring effective decision-making based on user-centric data.
