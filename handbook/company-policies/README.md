# Company Policies

Our company policies are designed to foster a fair, supportive, and productive work environment. These guidelines ensure that everyone is aligned with our core values and practices, helping us maintain high standards of professionalism and a positive workplace culture.

While a startup mindset often requires embracing dynamic methods at various times, we believe that establishing clear boundaries and guidelines helps increase work efficiency and build team trust. By setting these policies, we create a foundation that can support future growth and scalability of our systems, ensuring consistency and reliability within our team.

Therefore, we have outlined our current policies on this page, which can be developed further as needed. This approach helps us maintain a structured yet adaptable framework that aligns with our core values and supports our overall mission.
