# Communication Guidelines

### **Asking Questions**

Encourage team members to seek answers in the project documentation or FAQ or Discord sections first. If the question remains unresolved, they should use the designated communication channels, tagging the relevant team members or roles.

### **Suggesting Ideas**

Before presenting an idea, team members should gather some preliminary data or research to support their suggestion. Ideas should be presented during team meetings or shared in the ideas channel on the teamâ€™s communication platform, providing enough context to facilitate discussion.

## Guidelines for Making Suggestions

### **Identify the Issue**

Clearly state the problem or opportunity for improvement. Provide context and explain why it is significant to the team or project.

### **Propose Possible Solutions**

Alongside the suggestion, provide one or more potential solutions. Solutions should be feasible and consider existing constraints. Detailing possible approaches demonstrates proactive thinking and helps facilitate constructive discussion.

### **Support with Evidence**

Where possible, back up your suggestion with data, examples, or references. This could include user feedback, performance metrics, or research that supports the need for change and the effectiveness of your proposed solution.

### **Consider Impact**

Discuss the potential impact of your suggestion, including benefits and any potential drawbacks. Understanding the broader implications can help the team evaluate the suggestion's overall value.\


### **Openness to Feedback**

Be open to feedback on your suggestion. The goal is to foster a collaborative environment where ideas are shared, discussed, and refined collectively.
