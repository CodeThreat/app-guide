# Task Management

**Task Creation**

Each task needs to be detailed and clear to ensure everyone understands what needs to be done. A good task includes:

* **Title:** A clear, concise description of the task.
* **Description:** Detailed objectives, expected outcomes, and relevant background.
* **Priority Level:** Assigned based on urgency and importance.
* **Estimated Time:** An approximation of how long it should take.
* **Assignee:** The team member responsible for the task.

**Task Tracking**

Once a task is created, it moves through defined stages in our workflow to ensure progress is monitored and managed effectively. Our stages are:

* **To Do:** Tasks ready to start.
* **Doing:** Tasks in progress.
* **Review:** Tasks pushed to test instances for assessment.
* **Done:** Completed tasks that meet all defined acceptance criteria.

Regular updates through sprint-related activities and clear communication in task tracking are essential to ensure transparency and enable team members to anticipate dependencies and manage their workload effectively.
