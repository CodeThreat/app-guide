# Priority Management

This section delves into how we prioritize tasks at CodeThreat, ensuring our focus aligns with the most impactful work that drives us towards our objectives. We adopt the MoSCoW method to classify tasks based on their urgency and importance. The MoSCoW Method is a prioritization technique used to categorize tasks into four groups, helping the team focus on what's truly important.

### Must Have (Critical for Delivery) - 1&#x20;

These tasks are non-negotiable for the sprint or release to be successful. They often address critical bugs, security vulnerabilities, or features essential to meet compliance or customer requirements. Failure to deliver these tasks could significantly impact the project's timeline or quality.

### Should Have (High Value, Not Time-Critical)  - 2&#x20;

Important tasks that should be included in the current development cycle if resources allow. These enhancements or features add significant value but do not endanger the release if postponed.

### Could Have (Nice to Have, Lower Priority)  - 3&#x20;

These are desired features that would benefit the product but are not essential for the current cycle. These tasks are considered only after all 'Must Have' and 'Should Have' tasks are allocated.

### Wonâ€™t Have (This Time)  - 4&#x20;

Tasks or features deemed not essential for the current release. This category helps manage scope and maintain focus on priorities.



### Measuring Impact and Urgency

#### Impact

Assessed by considering the task's potential to affect user satisfaction, revenue, strategic goals, or technical debt. High-impact tasks significantly advance our product's value proposition.

#### Urgency

Determined by time constraints, external dependencies, and potential consequences of delays. High-urgency tasks have immediate deadlines or are prerequisites for other critical work.

#### Implementation

Each sprint planning session begins with categorizing upcoming tasks using the MoSCoW method. This process involves collaborative discussions among the team to assess each task's relative importance and urgency, ensuring alignment with our overall product strategy and immediate goals.
