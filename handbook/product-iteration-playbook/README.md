# Product Iteration Playbook

This playbook serves as our guiding document, providing a concise version of a much more detailed process.

Initially, our task statuses and types might not resemble those of conventional systems. Over the past four years, CodeThreat has experimented with three different methodologies to develop its unique system. While this system may evolve and improve over time, the foundational principles and methods we adhere to and strive to implement are outlined here.

We've tailored our approach to suit the dynamic nature of our startup environment, ensuring that we remain agile and responsive to the challenges we face. This playbook captures the essence of our iterative process, offering a structured yet flexible framework for product development.

By documenting our processes in this way, we aim to provide clarity and consistency across the team, enabling us to work more effectively together. This playbook is not just a set of rules but a living document that will grow and adapt as we do, always reflecting our commitment to excellence and continuous improvement.

As we continue to refine our methods and improve our workflows, this playbook will serve as a cornerstone for our operations, ensuring that everyone on the team is aligned with our goals and understands the steps we take to achieve them.
