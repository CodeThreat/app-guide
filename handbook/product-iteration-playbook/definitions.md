This section provides clarity on the fundamental building blocks of our task management system: epics, stories, issues, bugs and tasks. Understanding these concepts is crucial for effective planning and communication within the team.

### Epics or Stories

Epics: Large-scale initiatives that embody significant goals within your project, representing substantial areas like new feature sets or system enhancements. They consolidate related features and issues to achieve a major outcome for the project. For instance, "Adding Language Support for Program Analysis: Go" would be categorized as an epic.

Here are some Epic examples;

* ‘Adding Language Support for Program Analysis: Go’ could be an epic that comprises a substantial addition to CodeThreat solution and should be discovered, designed and divided into features.
* ‘Enhance and Harden SaaS Authentication Mechanism’ could be a Cloud portal enhancement that requires discovery and design.
* ‘Support HIPAA Compliance Standard for SAST Results’ could be an important customer required addition to presenting SAST findings with respect to HIPAA compliance standard control items.
* ‘A Customizable User Dashboard with Widgets’ could be an important addition for users and teams to be able to digest their CodeThreat data using high-level graphics in a customizable UI environment.

**Stories**: Typically, these are distinct from epics and represent more manageable, user-focused objectives that still contribute to the overarching goals of an epic. Each story outlines a specific user need or feature that aids in fulfilling the broader objective outlined by the epic. But for us, a story means more work and its effort could be higher even, we may consider it the same as epic.&#x20;

### Issues or Bugs

Issues or bugs detail the specific challenges, new features, or defects that are encountered within the scope of an epic or a story.&#x20;

Issues refer to new functionalities or enhancements, while bugs denote problems or errors within the existing system. For example, within the epic of "Enhance and Harden SaaS Authentication Mechanism," an issue might be "Implement Multi-Factor Authentication Support."

### Tasks

These are the smallest units in the workflow and describe actionable steps required to resolve an issue or to fulfill a story. Tasks are specific, actionable, and measurable pieces of work that contribute directly towards solving a larger issue or completing a feature. An example of a task might be "Design the user interface for Multi-Factor Authentication setup."\


Epics or Stories set the stage by outlining large-scale goals or significant user-centric features. They provide the big picture and set the direction for the work to be undertaken.

Issues or Bugs break down the epics or stories into more tangible challenges or objectives. They offer a more detailed view of what needs to be accomplished to move towards the larger goals.

Tasks dissect the issues or bugs into smaller, actionable steps. They are the individual assignments that team members execute on, enabling the team to track progress in detail and ensuring focused efforts towards resolving specific problems or implementing defined features.
