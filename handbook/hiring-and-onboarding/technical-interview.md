# Technical Interview

The technical interview at CodeThreat is where we dive into your technical skills and problem-solving abilities. This interview typically lasts between 60-90 minutes and involves coding challenges, project discussions, and, for senior roles, system design exercises.

**What We Look For**

* **Coding Skills:** We want to see how you approach coding problems and your proficiency in the languages and tools we use.
* **Problem-Solving:** How do you tackle complex problems? We’re interested in your thought process and how you break down challenges.
* **Technical Knowledge:** We’ll discuss your understanding of software development principles, best practices, and relevant technologies.

**What to Expect**

* **Real-World Scenarios:** We use practical coding challenges that reflect the kind of work you’ll be doing at CodeThreat.
* **Interactive Session:** You’ll be working through problems live, often with one of our engineers. This is a collaborative process, so think out loud and share your reasoning.
* **Feedback and Discussion:** We’ll provide feedback on your approach and discuss different ways to solve the problems. This is also a chance for you to ask technical questions about our work.
