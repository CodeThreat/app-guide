# Squads

Our team structure is designed to foster collaboration, innovation, and efficiency. We have organized our teams to maximize synergy and leverage diverse skill sets. Currently, we are divided into three main teams: the Product Team, the AppSec Researcher Team, and the Analyzer Team. Each team has specific roles but works closely together to achieve our goals.

#### Why This Structure?

A well-organized team structure is essential for our success. By dividing our team into specialized groups, we can focus on key areas of our product and ensure that each aspect receives the attention it deserves. This structure also allows us to quickly adapt to changes and address challenges efficiently.

#### Future Development

We currently do not have dedicated business-side teams, but we recognize their importance and plan to develop them in the future. As we grow, we will incorporate teams focused on business development, marketing, sales, and customer support. These future additions will help us expand our reach and better serve our users.
