# Diversity & Inclusion

We believe that every individual, regardless of sexual orientation, race, religion, or ideology, should be evaluated based on their skills, determination, and consistency. This approach ensures that we focus on what truly matters: the work and contributions of each team member.

#### Merit-Based Evaluation

Diversity at CodeThreat is approached with a focus on merit and professional capability. During the hiring process, we do not practice positive discrimination because we prioritize the quality of work over personal characteristics. While this might seem sub-optimal to some, we believe that excluding parameters unrelated to our user's problems from our hiring and team-building practices is crucial.

We recognize the richness that racial and sexual diversity brings, but we do not consider these factors in team formation. Instead, we focus on the individual's professional capabilities and contributions. This merit-based approach ensures that every team member is valued for their work and not for characteristics unrelated to their job performance.

#### Embracing Equality

**Equality in Processes**: Our commitment to an egalitarian approach helps maintain balance across all CodeThreat processes. We strive to ensure that the same effort, performance, and team contributions are recognized and celebrated, regardless of personal background. This approach allows us to focus on supporting and celebrating the successes of our team members based on their achievements.

**Support and Celebration**: We aim to support and celebrate individuals who demonstrate exceptional performance and team contributions. This support is provided without consideration of any extraneous parameters, ensuring that everyone has an equal opportunity to succeed and be recognized.
