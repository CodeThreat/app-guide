#### Transparency with Everyone

At CodeThreat, we believe that transparency is the cornerstone of trust and collaboration. We maintain open communication across all levels, ensuring that every decision's rationale is accessible to everyone, from end-users to our newest team members. This openness not only enhances accountability but also makes our decisions more valuable.&#x20;

By fostering an environment where individuals can express their expectations and desires transparently, we cultivate a culture of mutual respect and continuous improvement. This commitment to transparency is one of the core values that define CodeThreat.

#### Anti-Pattern Awareness

In our dynamic industry, adaptability and continuous improvement are crucial. Our team excels in recognizing and embracing change, quickly adjusting to new challenges. We understand that there are multiple correct ways to approach a problem, each with its unique impacts and opportunities. However, certain paths may present significant pitfalls or inefficiencies.

To avoid these, we emphasize the importance of anti-pattern awareness. This involves identifying common mistakes and suboptimal practices, ensuring we learn from them and steer clear of problematic paths. By continually researching and understanding these anti-patterns, we can find the most effective solutions and optimal paths for our projects. This approach drives our teams towards excellence in MVP production and feature development, ensuring we consistently deliver high-quality outcomes.

#### Problem Obsession

At CodeThreat, solving problems is our passion. We adopt a "make it work" mindset, viewing problem-solving as key to both personal and professional growth. Our approach is not merely about solutions but about truly understanding the problems, examining all angles, and crafting innovative strategies.

Our dedication to solving problems means we never settle for superficial or temporary fixes. We aim for thorough and sustainable solutions that tackle issues at their core. This principle guides our product development, user support, and team collaboration, making us more resilient and effective in overcoming challenges.

#### Adaptability and Continuous Improvement

In the ever-evolving field of cybersecurity, staying ahead requires constant adaptation and improvement. Our team thrives on embracing change and leveraging it as an opportunity for growth. We regularly review and refine our processes, tools, and strategies to ensure we remain at the forefront of the industry.

Adaptability means being open to new ideas, willing to pivot when necessary, and continuously seeking better ways to achieve our goals. By fostering a culture of continuous improvement, we ensure that every team member is empowered to contribute to our collective success and drive innovation forward.
